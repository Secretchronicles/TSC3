How to translate TSC3
=====================

It's easy. TSC uses a software named "Gettext" to provide the
translations, and this software requires translations to be stored in
a format called "PO". To edit files of this format, install a PO
editor of your choice. If you don't have a specific preference, we
recommend you use POEdit (<https://poedit.net/>), which is free
software. If you're an Emacs user, you can use the PO-Mode supplied
with Gettext itself.

1. Once you acquired a PO editor, get a copy of the TSC3 source tree,
   e.g. by cloning it from Git or downloading and extracting a source
   tarball.

2. Then, open a terminal and navigate to the directory this file you are
   currently reading resides in.

3. Now determine the two-letter country code of your language using the
   Internet. For German, it's "de" for example.

4. (If you want to edit an existing translation, skip this step.)
   If you want to create a new translation, copy the file "TSC3.po" to
   "de.po" (or whatever two-letter country code your language has, plus
   ".po").

        $ cp TSC3.pot de.po

5. (If you want to edit an existing translation, skip this step.)
   Adapt the Gettext header to your language's needs. Especially
   important is to specify the "Content-Type" line correctly,
   which should almost always read:

       "Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8"

   Fill in the rest of the Gettext header as you see fit. Do not touch
   the "POT-Creation-Date" line. Remove the "#, fuzzy" comment line
   when you're done.

6. Now synchronize your translation with the master POT file by executing
   this command:

        $ make de.po

    It can happen that this command also updates the POT master file,
    because the TSC source code changed since it was last updated.
    This is normal, don't let that scare you.

7. Translate all the strings in the PO file.

8. Submit the edited PO file to the TSC team. To do that, either open
   a ticket or pull request at <https://github.com/Secretchronicles/TSC3>,
   or subscribe to the tsc-devel mailinglist at
   <https://lists.secretchronicles.org/postorius/lists/tsc-devel.lists.secretchronicles.org/>
   and then email the translation to that list.
