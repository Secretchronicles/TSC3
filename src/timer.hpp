     * A lightweight timer class. Once configured for a specific
     * duration (in milliseconds), it is said to be "active", or
     * "ticking" if you want. It records the moment it was started,
     * and once from the duration of time configured has elapsed,
     * IsOver() will return true. During that period, IsActive()
     * returns true as well, and it will continue to return true
     * even after the amount of time configured has passed.
     *
     * Instances of this class do not have to do anything with threads.
     * All they do is to record a start timestamp, and each time you
     * query the instance, the current time is compared against that
     * timestamp. As a consequence, there's no possibility to specify
     * a callback somewhere. The intentional use of this class is in
     * the Update() routine of your scene, where you act accordingly
     * once you see the timer has finished.
