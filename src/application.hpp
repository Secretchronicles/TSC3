     * The Application class contains the game's most basic setup. It can
     * mostly be seen as an OOP abstraction over the main() function that
     * has a constructor and destructor for proper cleanup. It's a singleton
     * class, which means that only ever one instance of it can be constructed;
     * once done, this instance can be retrieved via the Instance() method. Any
     * further attempt to construct a new instance will cause an exception.
     *
     * Additionally, this class serves as a container for those pieces of
     * global information that were to small to warrant its own global object.
     * For example, this class thus contains the FPS counter. It also holds the
     * scene stack and owns the SFML game window.
