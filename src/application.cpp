/**
 * Removes the topmost scene from the stack and returns it.

 * mainloop takes care of popping your current scene off the
 * stack.
 *
 * \returns The scene that was on the top of the scene stack.
 *
 * \remark If you do use this method, be very careful about the
 * return value. If you call it from the currently active scene,
 * it will return the pointer to the very scene that is currently
 * executing, i.e., it's return value will be equal to the
 * `this` pointer, just wrapped in a std::unique_ptr. If you
 * let it go out of scope in such a situation (e.g., by not
 * catering for the return value), unique_ptr's implementation will
 * free the memory occupied by it, i.e., it will delete your
 * `this` pointer while you're still executing a method on it!
 * That is going to cause a segfault for obvious reasons, so, if
 * calling this method from the active scene, do store the return
 * value until you are done with your scene, then let it run out
 * of scope to have unique_ptr clean things up for you.
