     * The Ground is an SFML-like entity to draw the level ground from a
     * tileset. It uses just a single, large vertex array for the entire
     * level ground, thus rendering a Ground object is pretty fast despite
     * of its usually large extends. The downside of it is that you're
     * restricted to construct your Ground object from a single tileset.
     * This is actually good for level consistency, but if you really need
     * a second tileset, you can still instanciate a second Ground object.
     *
     * The tileset consists of *tiles* as drawn in your favourite graphics
     * programme to the PNG file. The tileset has columns and rows; how many,
     * is defined via the tileset metadata XML file. The width and height of
     * the image in pixels have to be evenly dividable through the number
     * of columns and rows, respectively, otherwise you will receive undesired
     * drawing errors.
     *
     * The ground then consists of *fields* (class Field), which describe where
     * to place a copy of which tile. This list of fields, along with the
     * desired tileset to draw them from, constitute the arguments of the Ground()
     * constructor. It is not the Ground class' job to parse the list of
     * fields from the level XML format; that's left for the level loader. This
     * is proper task division and allows to construct a Ground object from
     * memory directly if required (could be useful for scripting).
     *
     * Collision information for the ground is read from the tileset metadata
     * XML as well.
