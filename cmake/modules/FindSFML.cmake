#
# Usage:
#
# find_package(SFML COMPONENTS ... [REQUIRED])
#
# Possible components are: audio, graphics, network, system, window.
# You almost always want the "system" component.
#
# Example:
#
# find_package(SFML COMPONENTS window system REQUIRED)
#
# This module sets the following variables:
#
# SFML_INCLUDE_DIRS: Path to the SFML library headers
# SFML_LIBRARIES: List of all requested component libraries
# SFML_DEFINITIONS: Possible required cflags such as SFML_STATIC
#
# Also sets SFML_INCLUDE_DIR to the same value as SFML_INCLUDE_DIRS,
# for compatibility.
