This directory exists as the compiler -I option directory for pathie,
because Pathie's source layout is broken. It doesn't have a pathie/
subdirectory inside include/ unless you invoke $ make install, which
cmake doesn't do in a subdirectory build.

Correct solution is to fix Pathie's source layout upstream. See
<https://github.com/Quintus/pathie-cpp/issues/2>.
